# WardrobePalAndroid
Basic Version of Android App. API 21 Lollipop. 


Hello!

This is the first APP that I am creating. The idea is an app where the user can store their wardrobe items and be suggested an outfit. The app is very simple now, but I plan to make the features more exciting as time goes on. There are all kinds of possibilities for this idea. I got my inspiration from character creation screens in video games such as Skyrim, GTA, etc.

I am currently looking for testers for this app and need 20 to publish it on the Play Store. I am working on this task, and I will also shortly make a version for iOS. 

** CONTACT ME ** 

If you could help me by being a tester so I can publish this, that would be amazing.
